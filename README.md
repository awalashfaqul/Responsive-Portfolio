## Description

Created a personal website from scratch with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Tried to make the website responsive.

On the CV/Resume page, a print button is added to print out the CV, and it also can be saved as PDF format.

On the portfolio page, modals are introduced to share more information. By clicking on the more info button the visitors will have an idea about my work. 

On the contact page, modal will pop up when the "send now" button is clicked. That will provide information that the message is sent. However, to send a message it is necessary to use any SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) service.
